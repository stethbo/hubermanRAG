       "\n",
       "1. **Establish a consistent sleep schedule**: Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, including weekends, to regulate your body's internal clock.\n",
       "2. **Create a sleep-conducive environment**:\n",
       "\t* Make your bedroom dark, quiet, and cool (around 60-67°F/15-19°C).\n",
       "\t* Invest in a comfortable mattress and pillows.\n",
       "\t* Consider using blackout curtains, earplugs, or a white noise machine if necessary.\n",
       "3. **Develop a relaxing bedtime routine**: Wind down with activities like reading, meditation, deep breathing exercises, or yoga before bed.\n",
       "4. **Limit exposure to screens before bed**: Avoid using electronic devices for at least an hour before bedtime, as the blue light emitted from screens can suppress melatonin production.\n",
       "5. **Avoid stimulating activities before bedtime**:\n",
       "\t* Avoid intense exercise, caffeine, nicotine, and heavy meals within 2-3 hours of bedtime.\n",
       "\t* Try to manage stress with relaxation techniques or journaling instead of engaging in stimulating conversations or watching exciting movies.\n",
       "6. **Get regular physical activity**: Regular exercise can help improve sleep quality, but avoid vigorous exercise within a few hours of bedtime.\n",
       "7. **Try progressive muscle relaxation**: This technique involves tensing and relaxing different muscle groups to release tension and promote relaxation.\n",
       "8. **Limit naps**: If you need to nap, keep it short (under 30 minutes) and avoid napping close to bedtime.\n",
       "9. **Consider cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)**: If you struggle with chronic insomnia, CBT-I may help address underlying issues and develop healthier sleep habits.\n",
       "10. **Consult a healthcare professional**: If you continue to experience poor sleep quality or excessive daytime fatigue, consult with a healthcare expert to rule out any underlying medical conditions.\n",
       "\n",
       "Remember that individual sleep needs vary, so experiment with these suggestions and find what works best for you.\n",

So we do want to highlight that. Okay, so now let's answer Jack's question directly, which is how to increase the total amount of slow-wave sleep. Well, there are a couple ways.\n",

Basically everything in life gets better when we're sleeping well. So today I'm going to teach you the tools that will allow you to optimize your sleep. That is, get to sleep and stay asleep, fall back asleep if you wake up in the middle of the night, and adjust your sleep given the various life demands\n",

      "early part of the night, more of that time is going to be occupied by slow-wave sleep. The two ways to improve slow-wave sleep that are well documented in the literature, and here we can point to some really nice papers that I'll reference in case you want to read further, is the first one is entitled, Exercise Improves the Quality of Slow-Wave Sleep by Increasing Slow-Wave Stability. Slow-wave Stability has to do with, as researchers call it, the amount of power present\n",

      "start to implement some, or ideally, all of these tools, the quality of your sleep will increase tremendously. And of course, in doing so, the quality of your daytime alertness and your ability to focus will improve tremendously. Again, sleep is the absolute foundation of your mental health, your physical health, and your performance in all endeavors. So if there's one area of your life to really focus on and try and optimize, if your goal is to be happier and more productive\n",

But if you want to get better at sleeping, you want to get better at falling asleep, and you want to replace sleep that you've lost, I put that in quotes so that my colleagues like Matthew Walker don't come after me with... What would you come after me with, Matt? Probably with an alarm clock and, I don't know, blankets and a pillow or something of that sort. In all seriousness,\n",

      "being a functional human being, is to try and get enough quality deep sleep at least 80% of the nights of your life, if you can. That's something to focus on. Just like good nutrition, just like exercise and social connection, et cetera. So sleep deprivation, we know, in particular, I think rapid eye movement components of sleep deprivation can improve the symptoms of depression. And yet being sleep deprived can also really disregulate our control of the autonomic system.\n",

This was a question that was asked by Jack Pritchard and they got a lot of up votes. Now, we've done multiple full-length episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast on sleep and tools to improve sleep, including the Master Your Sleep episode and Perfect Your Sleep episode, as well as a toolkit that is available\n",
